    <div class="center-title"><h1>What is this website</h1></div>
    <div class="center-text"><p>This website is a demonstration website made by the developer to both learn the intricacies of full stack website development. It was developed following the waterfall SDLC methodology and using the HTML, CSS, javascript, and react for the frontend, and node.js with express for the backend. Furthermore, the website used a mySQL database and is hosted using AWS services. <br> <br> This websites design was made to be a marketplace in which individuals can easily list and purchase items in their possesions in a similar style to Gumtree and Ebay but with a focus on gaming merchandise such as board games, card games, video game equipment, and more. More about the design of the website including documentation of all stages of the SDLC can be found below. </p></div>

    <div class="center-title"><h1>Who is the developer</h1></div>
    <div class="center-text"><p>My name is Bailey Blackstock, I am a final year university student studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at Griffith University on the Gold Coast and I will be finishing my degree November 2024 and hope to enter the IT industry at that time. <br> <br> I made this website as I had a lack of previous experience in full stack development despite it's extreme employability, therefore during my university break I undertook the development of this website. I hope that this website serves as both a display of my skills in software development and as proof of my capacity to develop projects in line with industry standards. <br> <br> At the current moment I am still looking for an entry level job in software development, and if yoy are interested in contacting me please do so by emailing baileyblackstock02@gmail.com.</p></div>
